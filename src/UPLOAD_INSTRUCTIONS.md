# Instructions to Upload Code to GitHub

Follow these steps to push your code to the created GitHub repository:

1. If you haven't already, configure Git with your GitHub credentials:
```bash
git config --global user.name "gaikwadshailesh"
git config --global user.email "your-github-email@example.com"
```

2. Initialize the Git repository (if not already done):
```bash
git init
```

3. Add all files to Git:
```bash
git add .
```

4. Create the initial commit:
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Microservices Platform"
```

5. Link to your GitHub repository:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/gaikwadshailesh/microservices-platform.git
```

6. Set the main branch and push the code:
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Authentication

You'll need to authenticate with GitHub when pushing the code. You can do this in two ways:

1. Using Personal Access Token (Recommended):
   - Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens → Tokens (classic)
   - Generate a new token with 'repo' scope
   - When pushing, use the token as your password

2. Using GitHub CLI:
   - Install GitHub CLI
   - Run `gh auth login`
   - Follow the prompts to authenticate

## Important Notes

- Make sure you have Git installed on your computer
- The repository should be empty (no README, license, or .gitignore)
- If you see authentication errors, you'll need to use your GitHub Personal Access Token as the password

## Next Steps After Successful Push

1. Verify the code is on GitHub by visiting:
   https://github.com/gaikwadshailesh/microservices-platform

2. Set up branch protection rules (optional but recommended):
   - Go to repository Settings → Branches
   - Add rule for the 'main' branch
   - Enable required reviews for pull requests
