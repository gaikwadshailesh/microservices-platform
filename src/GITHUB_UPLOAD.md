# GitHub Upload Instructions

Follow these steps to upload the project to your GitHub repository:

## Step 1: Initialize Git Repository
```bash
git init
```
This command creates a new Git repository in your project directory. It initializes a hidden .git folder that will track all changes to your files.

## Step 2: Add Files to Git
```bash
git add .
```
The `.` means "all files". This command stages all your project files for commit, except those listed in .gitignore.

## Step 3: Initial Commit
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Microservices Platform"
```
This creates your first commit with all the project files. The message describes what's being committed.

## Step 4: Link to GitHub
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/gaikwadshailesh/microservices-platform.git
```
This connects your local repository to your GitHub repository. Make sure to create an empty repository named "microservices-platform" on your GitHub account first.

## Step 5: Push Code
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
This uploads your code to GitHub. The `-u` flag sets up tracking, so future pushes can be done with just `git push`.

## Troubleshooting

If you see an error about the main branch:
```bash
git branch -M main
```
Run this before pushing to rename your default branch to 'main'.

## Alternative Method: GitHub Desktop

If you prefer a visual interface:
1. Download and install GitHub Desktop
2. Go to File > Add Local Repository
3. Select your project folder
4. Click "Publish repository"
5. Choose your GitHub account
6. Set repository name to "microservices-platform"
7. Click "Publish Repository"

## Important Notes
- Make sure you have Git installed on your computer
- You need to be logged into your GitHub account
- The repository on GitHub should be empty (no README, license, or .gitignore)
- If you see authentication errors, you might need to:
  1. Configure Git with your GitHub email:
     ```bash
     git config --global user.email "your-github-email@example.com"
     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     ```
  2. Use a personal access token or SSH key for authentication
